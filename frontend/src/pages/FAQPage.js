    },
    {
      question: "Can I edit events I've created?",

    },
    {
      question: "What can admins do?",
      answer: "Admins have full system access. They can manage all events (create, edit, delete), manage users (approve organizer accounts, delete users), view all registrations, and access analytics about events and registrations."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I search for events?",

    {
      question: "Is there a limit to how many events I can register for?",
